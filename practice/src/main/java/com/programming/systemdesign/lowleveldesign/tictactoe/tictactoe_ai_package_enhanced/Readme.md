Design-Level Change
Which class(es) or structure(s) need to change.

Method/API You‚Äôd Add
New methods or interfaces you'd introduce.

Why It‚Äôs Easy to Integrate
Show how your current design already supports it (extensibility).

üîÑ Undo Feature
Objective: Allow players to revert the last move.

Design Change: Add a Stack<Move> in the Game class.

API: public void undoMove()

Implementation:

Pop the last move from the stack.

Reset that board cell to empty ('-').

Design Support: Since Move is a standalone data class, and Board encapsulates state, this change is local and safe.

üîÅ Replay Feature
Objective: Rewatch the entire game from start.

Design Change: Maintain a List<Move> for all moves played.

API: public void replayGame()

Implementation:

Create a fresh board.

Reapply all moves from the list with delays.

Optional: Use Thread.sleep(500) for visual effect.

Design Support: The board is separate from move logic; state restoration is easy.

ü§ñ AI Support using Strategy Pattern
Objective: Add computer-controlled players with varying difficulty.

Design Change: Create a MoveStrategy interface and inject into Player.

API:

java
Copy
Edit
interface MoveStrategy {
int[] getNextMove(Board board, Symbol symbol);
}
Example Implementations:

RandomMoveStrategy

MinimaxStrategy for unbeatable AI

Design Support: Player already selects moves ‚Äî just delegate that to a strategy object for AI players.

üí¨ Key Phrases to Use in Interview
"I‚Äôve isolated state changes in the Board class, so adding Undo is safe."

"Since Player is abstracted from move logic, I can inject different strategies for human or AI players."

"The design is open for extension but closed for modification ‚Äî following SOLID principles."

‚è≥ Out of Time? Say This
"Given more time, I'd implement Undo by tracking moves in a stack and exposing a simple undoMove() API. The design is already prepared for that."
